PASS locked should be false 
PASS Running templatedRSErroredSyncOnly with ReadableStream (errored via call in start) 
PASS should be able to obtain a second reader, with the correct closed promise 
PASS cancel() should return a distinct rejected promise each time

PASS Running templatedRSTwoChunksOpenReader with ReadableStream (two chunks enqueued, still open) reader 
PASS calling read() twice without waiting will eventually give both chunks 
PASS calling read() twice with waiting will eventually give both chunks 
PASS read() should return distinct promises each time 
PASS cancel() after a read() should still give that single read result

PASS third read(), without waiting, should give { value: undefined, done: true } 
PASS third read, with waiting, should give { value: undefined, done: true } 
PASS draining the stream via read() should cause the reader closed promise to fulfill and locked to be false 
PASS releasing the lock after the stream is closed should do nothing 
PASS releasing the lock should cause read() to act as if the stream is closed 
PASS reader's closed property always returns the same promise
