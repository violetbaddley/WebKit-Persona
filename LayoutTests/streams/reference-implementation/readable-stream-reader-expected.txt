PASS Can get the ReadableStreamReader constructor indirectly 
PASS ReadableStreamReader constructor should get a ReadableStream object as argument 
FAIL ReadableStreamReader instances should have the correct list of properties assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected 5 got 4
PASS ReadableStreamReader closed should always return the same promise object 
PASS Constructing a ReadableStreamReader directly should fail if the stream is already locked (via direct construction) 
PASS Getting a ReadableStreamReader via getReader should fail if the stream is already locked (via direct construction) 
PASS Constructing a ReadableStreamReader directly should fail if the stream is already locked (via getReader) 
PASS Getting a ReadableStreamReader via getReader should fail if the stream is already locked (via getReader) 
PASS Constructing a ReadableStreamReader directly should be OK if the stream is closed 
PASS Constructing a ReadableStreamReader directly should be OK if the stream is errored 
PASS Reading from a reader for an empty stream will wait until a chunk is available 
FAIL cancel() on a reader releases the reader before calling through cancel is not implemented
PASS closed should be fulfilled after stream is closed (.closed access before acquiring) 
FAIL closed should be fulfilled after reader releases its lock (multiple stream locks) releaseLock is not implemented
FAIL Multiple readers can access the stream in sequence releaseLock is not implemented
FAIL Cannot use an already-released reader to unlock a stream again releaseLock is not implemented
FAIL cancel() on a released reader is a no-op and does not pass through releaseLock is not implemented
PASS Getting a second reader after erroring the stream should succeed 
PASS Garbage-collecting a ReadableStreamReader should not unlock its stream
